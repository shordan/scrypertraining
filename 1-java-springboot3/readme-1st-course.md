# Notes on 1st Course of Scryper Training: Java and Spring Boot

## Introduction

Welcome to my notes on Java and Spring Boot. This repository contains key information and useful notes related to Java development and the Spring Boot framework.

### Java

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is known for its portability, meaning that Java programs can run on different platforms without modifications.

### Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a project within the Spring framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, especially microservices-based applications. It provides a set of pre-configured and opinionated conventions to ease configuration and rapid deployment of Spring applications.
